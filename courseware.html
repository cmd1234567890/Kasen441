                   It is not a programming language, but consists of a series of tags through 
                   which the format of documents on the network can be unified, so that the scattered
                    Internet resources can be connected into a logical whole</p>

                <h2>JAVA course</h2>  
                <p>Java has a wide range of applications in a variety of fields, such as writing
                  desktop applications, web applications, distributed systems, and embedded system 
                  applications. Whether it's a large enterprise or a startup, whether it's in the field 
                  of mobile app development or cloud computing, Java is one of the preferred development 
                  languages. Java is also widely used in e-commerce and web development. In addition, Java
                   has important applications in the financial services industry, and its rich library and 
                   tool support, as well as strong security mechanisms, make Java advantageous for developing 
                   applications that involve large amounts of user data and transactions.</p>

                <h2>Python course</h2>  
                <p>Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented scripting language. 
                  Its design philosophy emphasizes the readability of code and allows developers
                   to express ideas in a small amount of code, while supporting a variety of programming
                    paradigms, including process-oriented, object-oriented, and functional programming. 
                    Python also has a large number of third-party libraries and frameworks, such as Pandas
                     (which provides data structures and data analysis tools), Matplotlib (a graph library), 
                     Scikit-learn (a machine learning library), Django (a web framework), etc., which greatly 
                     expand the capabilities and applications of Python.</p>

                <p>C++ is a widely used programming language, and C++ is an object-oriented programming language
                   that supports the concepts of classes and objects. This makes the code more modular and reusable, 
                   and provides object-oriented features such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
                   C++ is a compiled language that provides low-level access to hardware and is therefore generally
                    performant. This makes C++ the first choice for developing performance-hungry applications such 
                    as gaming, scientific computing, and embedded systems.</p>

                <p>SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language for manipulating databases.
                   It is used to create databases, delete databases, query records, modify records, 
                   add fields, and more. SQL is a computer language used to store, retrieve, and modify
                    data stored in relational databases. It is the standard language for relational databases, 
                    and all relational database management systems (RDBMS), such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server,
                     MS Access, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, etc., use SQL as their standard processing language.</p>
